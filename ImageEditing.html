		<p>I chose to create a book cover for the novel: Dark Places by Gillian Flynn. This book is considered a psychological thriller with a lot of dark themes. Most of the books I "read" are audiobooks I listen to while I run. My design process has many layers to get the dark themes I wanted. I started by finding a picture of the farmhouse/tree. The original picture had a bright sunny sky in the background. I turned the photo black and white and then removed the sky background. Next, I found a picture that had the perspective I needed of dark clouds. I placed the clouds and horizon line to fit the same horizon line of my farmhouse. I also turned the clouds into a black-and-white image and changed the levels a bit to make them not so dark. I made sure the farmhouse layer was on top so the tree branches would still be seen. Next, I wanted to find a font for the title that fits the mood of the book. I found a distressed font and used a selection tool to cut out the text from a red background and a black background to overlay the text. I used red as the only color due to the dark events that occur in the book. I was only going to use the red title but thought that it looked better with the black and red giving it more depth and a red shadow seemed more ominous. Finally, I added the author's name in a simple text at the bottom and adjusted the opacity to blend into the foreground better. Overall the challenging part of the design was to get the background cut out of the tree area so that the tree branches are still present. I imagine there was an easier way to do what I did but it worked in the the end. I also like how the text of the title goes behind the tree in the layers. I used the website called photopea to create this image.</p>


<p>I made a logo for one of my favorite sayings that I created as a coach and runner. I always with my friends and athletes "Fast Dreams" the night before a race or big workout. It's my way of saying goodnight and good luck all at the same time so I wanted to create a fun logo for it. Creating this logo with all vectors was a challenge for me. I have never worked with just vectors. I have only ever worked with editing bitmap photos. I started creating and was frustrated at first but got the hang of it with some tutorials. I created the moon using two circles. A black circle with a white circle on top. The moon is used to represent nighttime and sleeping. I next created a road using the drawing pen and made a custom shape that had perspective going off into the distance. I kept using the custom pen to create the lines on the road. I created multiple small black rectangles to overlay the solid white line to create the hash marks in the road. Next, I simply used pre-made star shapes at the top of the moon to continue the night theme. I thought it was missing something so I created an image of a runner. It was hard creating a running out of rectangles and circles but I think it turned out pretty solid. Finally, I added the phrase "Fast Dreams". I kept moving around the text to the inside, outside, and beneath the moon to find the best spot for it. I landed on the bottom of the moon to try and balance out the logo since the eyes were drawn to the left side of the logo. Being able to convert a circle to a path and then placing the text on the path took me a few different attempts but I finally got it to work. I only used black and white because I like the contrast and the ease of printing and using it as a logo on anything. The color can always be changed. I also like to work with black and white due to being red/green color blind. I struggle to come up with good color schemes and make items look good together. This photo was created in Inkscape.</p>
