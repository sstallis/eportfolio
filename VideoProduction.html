		<p>I created an informational video about the World Majors Marathons. I had trouble at first finding photos and logos from each marathon so I had to broaden my search from the suggested free photo sites. I chose to find a logo for the race series, the logo for each race, a skyline of the city for each race, and then two race pictures for each race. For my transitions, I used a mosaic transition from the logo to the skyline for all cities. I used a dissolve transition for all photos of the races and a fade-to-black transition before a new race logo was shown. For all skyline photos, I used a black-and-white filter to try to be a little artsy and consistent throughout the video. I used the Ken Burns effect on all the city logos and city skylines and used still photos for everything else. For each skyline photo, I added a title for when that race became a World Major. In addition, I added text to the title slide and the credit slide. The music I used for the background was a hopeful/upbeat tune from freetouse.com. I faded the background music in and out and set the sound to be lower in the background so my narration audio could be heard. I added a picture overlay of the New World major logo over the Sydney marathon logo since the race was just added and a new logo was introduced. My photos are all set to be the same time length. I created this entire video in iMovie. I hope that you enjoy the video and that you attempt to run at least one World Major one day or run them all like me! </p>
