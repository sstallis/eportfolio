		<p>I struggled initially to think of a quick topic for the 15-second timeframe. I ended up choosing the moon phases after my daughter was very excited to see the moon last night plus I used to be an earth science teacher. Fun fact I also was a contestant on the game show Let's Make a Deal and Wayne Brady quizzed me on the current moon phase (I did not get zonked!) </p>

I used Adobe Animate to create my project. I have used Adobe projects before and thought I would pick up the program quickly but it took me some time to catch my bearings. I could use a ton more time playing around to be able to dig deep. I went through many iterations on how I wanted to create my moon phases. I started with pictures of the moon and tried to mask over the shadow later with a transparency on and it was not working how I envisioned. So then I want a simple route that aligns more with this project by creating all my moon objects and shadows as a vector. I used a simple black background and a black shadow that overlaid a grey moon. I would use a keyframe to move the shadow one frame at a time to make the shadow appear smooth across the surface of the moon. The onion tool was helpful to move the shadow just a little bit every time. Using the left and right keys to move over more precisely was also helpful. I added the name of each phase of the moon in a text keyframe. After all the phases and text were created I placed some start vectors around the background to give a space vibe. I slightly rotated the stars back and forth using keyframes to make the overall image fun and visually appealing as the phases were occurring. The moon starts in a new moon phase (not visible) goes through all the phases and turns back to invisible to start the cycle over again.  </p>

My narration was not surer informative as there are so many phases and only a short amount of time so I ended up announcing each phase as they occurred. I also added a little space theme audio to the background to create a fun atmosphere for the project (space joke). </p>
