		<p>I had the opportunity to transform a quiz template into my very own Marvel Quiz Challenge, and it was an exciting project! As a passionate fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), designing a quiz around this theme was a genuinely enjoyable experience. I renamed the quiz to Marvel Quiz Challenge, a title that sets the tone for an engaging and fun experience. To create a more immersive visual experience, I changed the overall background color to a light grey, which provided a subtle yet professional look. I styled the text in white and paired it with dark buttons and backgrounds for the question box, solution box, and drop-down menu to ensure readability and contrast. </p>

To reflect the bold and heroic essence of Marvel, I added a gold outline around all the objects, creating a thematic connection. I also tweaked the "Cheat Mode" text to make it stand out with a darker shade, ensuring that even optional features felt cohesive with the theme. I updated the body text to acknowledge the script powering the quiz, giving proper credit while keeping it engaging. In the JavaScript code, I extended the quiz from 5 to 10 questions to make it more comprehensive and entertaining. Each question and its solution were adapted to Marvel themes. For instance, I added a playful compliment like "Your knowledge is a MARVELous!" for correct answers to enhance user enjoyment. </p>

To give the quiz a more polished and contemporary feel, I applied a border-radius property to buttons, making them rounded and visually appealing. Finally, I uploaded the files to GitHub, selecting it as a free and accessible platform for sharing my quiz with a wider audience. This was a great learning moment in making my project publicly available and building familiarity with version control and hosting.</p>

This project allowed me to merge technical skills with creativity. I enjoyed working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tailor the quiz to a topic I am passionate about. Adjusting colors, styles, and interactivity taught me how small design choices can significantly impact the user experience. Additionally, hosting the quiz on GitHub helped me explore practical ways to share projects online effectively. This experience has inspired me to consider creating more quizzes or interactive web-based tools in the future. I also want to continue refining my skills in JavaScript to build more dynamic and engaging user experiences. Overall, it was a rewarding project that allowed me to showcase my MCU enthusiasm while enhancing my technical abilities!</p>
